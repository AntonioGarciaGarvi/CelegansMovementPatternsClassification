# Instructions
To generate the synthetic skeleton segmentation data we used the Wormpose simulator.\
Subsequently, we trained the model and generated the predictions on the dataset we used for the classification network. \
These 3 steps (synthetic data generation, model training and prediction on the real dataset) were performed using the script available in its repository [1]. \ 
To use it, simply prepare your own dataset and change the corresponding paths in the script.
