# üí° Usage
First of all, the dataset must be created with a folder structure in which the original images are on one side and the skeleton masks on the other side.
- **Dataset**
  - **/images/**
    - *Description:* Directory containing image files.
      - Example: `image001.jpg`, `image002.jpg`, ...

  - **/masks/**
    - *Description:* Directory containing mask files.
      - Example: `mask001.jpg`, `mask002.jpg`, ..


Afterwards, the **config.py** file must be edited to adjust the paths and some hyperparameters.
Finally, run the script **train.py**
